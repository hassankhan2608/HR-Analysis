**Business Task:**
Analyze the data to determine:
- Total employee count and the Percentage rate of Attrition
- Employees attrition rate as influenced by:
i. Demography.
ii. Job duty.
iii. Employee engagement.
iv. Organization.

### Analysis Report:
#### Attrition Rate by Employee Engagement
- Employees with **Low Performance** has quite significant high attrition of 84.39%, while by **Job involvement** and **Work-Life-Balance** present a significant rise in attrition at the **"Moderate"** level.
 This implies that the attrition in these cases was caused by neither a poor nor excellent Job experience.
- **Job Overtime** or not, also, does not seem to be a factor, yet there is nearly the same attrition rate in both cases, while employees located near the work environment has significant high attrition rate of 60.80%.
#### Attrition Rate by Job Duty
- Employees at the **Entry Level** has the highest attrition rate of 60.33% with 143 attrition counts, while the **Senior** and the **Executive Level** barely have attrition.
#### Attrition Rate by Department
- The **Research & Development** has the highest rate of 56%, followed by the **Sales** department with 38.80%.
- Tracking further through the **Job Role,** Laboratory Technician and Sales Executive dominate the attrition with 26% and 24% respectively.
#### Attrition Rate by Organization
- **Job and Relationship Satisfaction** do not seem to have much influence in employee retention as, apparently, satisfied employees dominate the attrition in both cases.
However, the **Job Environment** is a huge factor as 30% of the attrited employees are very dissatisifed with the environment.
